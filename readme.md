My name is guilherme cunha pegoraro and im a software engineer student, this is my first project, my very own website.
nothing fancy now, but as time goes on i will try my best add new stuff, trying to do at least something new added everyday.

what i did (that is worth mentioning):
- added a photo of my dog
- changed bg color
- added a ethanol or gasoline calculator 
- changed font

what i want to do:
- add different fonts and colors
- maybe add a list with the values of all cars available in brazil? idk might be hard tho
- add an animation to "site do guilherme pegoraro"
- translate everything to english and find a way for the user to alternate between languages
- add more stuff to add
- adicionar destaque ao cartao ao apertar botao
